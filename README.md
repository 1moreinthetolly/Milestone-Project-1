Tic Tac Toe

Overview:
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This game allows the User to take turns versus the CPU marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, attempting to get three of their letters (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. User controls X, while CPU controls O.

How to Play:
Make your move on the interactive grid by clicking any of the available spaces. Winning conditions are met when a player (either the User or CPU) gets three in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends in a draw when the grid is full with no winning conditions met.
